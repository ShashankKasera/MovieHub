# Movie Hub


Movie Stack gives you an overview of Movies TV shows & Actors from the largest community network The Movie Database (TMDb), like IMDB. You can discover movies and TV series, or browse through many categories to get the right information.

In this project, I will use Android with Kotlin, MVVM, Dagger Hilt, Coroutines, Databinding, Retrofit, Room Database, Pagination & Android JetPack.
